                        <p> How can teams from the West contend with Golden State? It's always hard to compete with a team that has 2 former MVP's and 4 All-Stars. How can SAS and HOU upgrade their rosters and defeat GS? With the recent pickup of CP3, Houston has already developed their roster by ugrading from Patrick Beverely, but is it enough to keep up with potentially the best roster in NBA history. Sources say Kyrie is willing to go to the Spurs but who can the Spurs trade for him. Ever since Pop has taken over the head coach role, the Spurs have been a very conservative team since, and they are not the type of team to trade important assets and role players for one guy. And don't count out Minnesota to compete with th Warriors. It'll be interesting to see what happens.
                          <p> Warriors have officially re-signed KD and Stephen Curry. The two former MVP's and all-stars have both signed to stay. Steph Curry signed the super-max contract worth $201 million over 5 years and KD took a $6 million paycut and signed a 2 year contract worth $53 million
                            <p> LeBron ending up in LA alongside Zo after 2017-2018 season?
                              <p> Who will be the biggest bust of the 2017 draft class? Lonzo, Fultz, Fox, Josh Jackson. Who will it be? We all know Lonzo can pass a ball through 25 defenders and that he won Summer League MVP, but there are plenty players who dominated the Summer League but when we see them play in real games we have to pause the TV to see their last name or look up who they are. We'll see who shines and who chokes.
